# Programming-Scripting-Project
Final project for Programmimg and Scripting module - 2018

## Project Plan and Timeline for completing the project.

### Project Plan.
The project plan is to follow the the suggestion in the project outline with the combining of some tasks.
My plan for the project is as follows :

#### Research, Document and Summarise.

Research, document and summarize my findings in a clear and concise manner.
Be sure to include interesting findings from others analysis on the data set and
make sure to add the references to these findings. Also decide what type of
analysis you want to include in your findings beyond the max, min and mean of
each column. Would including a table or graph be helpful?

#### Download, Code and Summarise.

Download the data set and write some code to do the chosen analysis (ie. max, min, mean etc).
Summarise my findings on the analysis. Is there any interesting findings? Did I come across
someone else's analysis that was interesting? If so, say a little something about it and reference it.
MAKE SURE TO ADD COMMENTS TO MY CODE.

#### Final Summary.

Summarise my findings on the project. Is there any interesting findings? Did I come across
