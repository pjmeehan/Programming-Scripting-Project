# Programming-Scripting-Project
Final project for Programmimg and Scripting module - 2018

## Project Plan and Timeline for completing the project.

### Project Plan
The project plan is to follow the suggestion in the project outline with the combining of some tasks.
My plan for the project is as follows :

#### Research, Document and Summarise

Research, document and summarize my findings in a clear and concise manner.
Also decide what type of analysis you want to include in your findings beyond the max, min and mean of
each column. Would including a table or graph be helpful?

#### Download, Code and Summarise

Download the data set and write some code to do the chosen analysis (ie. max, min, mean etc).
Summarise my findings on my analysis. 
MAKE SURE TO ADD COMMENTS TO MY CODE.

#### Final Summary

Summarise my findings on the project. Is there any interesting findings? Did I come across
someone else's analysis that was interesting? If so, say a little something about it and reference it.
Make sure to include why this small data set is popular to analyze.

### Project Timeline

plan on spending 2 - 3 hours a day on the project until deadline.

13/04/18 break project down by section with detailed descriptions for completing each section.

14/04/18 - 15/04/18 Research, Document and Summarise.

16/04/18 - 20/04/18 Download, Code and Summarise.

21/04/18 - 22/04/18 Final Summary.

23/04/18 - 29/04/18 Review and update.


# FISHER'S IRIS DATA SET

Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Ronald Fisher in 1936. The data in the set was actually compiled by Edgar Anderson. He collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. (1)

The data set consists of 50 samples from each species, the Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor. For each sample, the
length and width of the sepals and petals were measured in centimetres.(1)(2)

Based on the findings, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.(1)

#### What is Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)?
According to Kardi Teknomo, PhD, "Linear Discriminant Analysis is a statistical method technique to classify objects into mutually exclusive and exhaustive groups based on a set of measurable features."(3) LDA allows for the prediction of a certain class (in Fisher's data set, it was the Iris class) based on the probability that certain inputs belong to such a class.(4)

It is because of this ability to predict, that LDA is popular with machine learning and pattern recognition. The Fisher data set is popular because it is a real world, small set of data that lends itself to be used in the testing in machine learning.
